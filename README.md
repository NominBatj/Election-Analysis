# Election Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the project is to analyze election audit of local congressional election in Colorado using programming tools: Python and Visual Studio Code and submit the result tp election commision.
## Election Audit Results 
The Electoral Commission requested additional analysis of the election data. Voter turnout count questions for each county that voted in the constituency. How to calculate the percentage of votes cast by each constituency in an election. We also were asked to determine which district had the largest turnout.
We created a python script where we performed calculations on the counts, used loops and if conditional statements to make a report to our analysis.
